# TODOs -

## This is what I would do if I had more time:

* I would add pagination.
* I would use the `useSearchParams` from NextJS to implement the search functionality.
* I would use a `.css` file and list out all of my styling there. I would import styling into my pages and components. I would add more custom styling too.
* I would add more tests. I was able to set up Jest tests with NextJS, but I only included a very basic test for each component.
* I would consider using a table from TanStack as opposed to the one I used.
